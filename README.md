# voucher_topup
This is a heavily edited version of the base voucher_topup
That closes some of the tracking and security concers of the base script. This Script is only for temporary use until the full version 2 etal is released 

To Add this etal to your etal folder just click on the clone or download button, select download as zip. 
Extract the folder and remove the '-master' from the end of the folder name. 
Make sure that the .moc and Etal.xml are in the root of the folder

This etal is dependent on the CheckErrorCorrect etal. Please make sure you have it in your etal folder as well
